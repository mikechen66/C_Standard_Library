# C_Standard_Library

The C standard library (libc) is the standard library for the C programming language, as specified in the ISO C standard.
Starting from the original ANSI C standard, it was developed at the same time as the C library POSIX specification, which 
is a superset. Since ANSI C was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, the C standard library is 
also called the ISO C library. The C standard library provides macros, type definitions and functions for tasks such as 
string handling, mathematical computations, input/output processing, memory management, and several other operating system 
services.

In total, there are now 29 header files. After a long period of stability, three new header files (iso646.h, wchar.h, and 
wctype.h) were added with Normative Addendum 1 (NA1), an addition to the C Standard ratified in 1995. Six more header files 
(complex.h, fenv.h, inttypes.h, stdbool.h, stdint.h, and tgmath.h) were added with C99, a revision published in 1999, and 
five more files (stdalign.h, stdatomic.h, stdnoreturn.h, threads.h, and uchar.h) with C11 in 2011.
